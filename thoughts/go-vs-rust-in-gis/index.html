			<p>As a Geospatially minded professional, I found something missing in the so called Go vs Rust war (see reddit 😅): <ins>what about GIS?</ins>. So here I will briefly list some of my thoughts developing in a geospatial application in Go and in Rust.</p>
<h1 id="go">Go</h1>
<p>Go is such an easy language to develop in. If you have used C or C++, you&rsquo;ll be writing Go in no time. If coming from Python it might take you few extra days to understand concepts such as pointers, references or point receivers. But again, in general, Go is the kind of language that you could easily convince other developers in your team to use with minimal learning curve. In terms of GIS packages, the best one <em>by far</em> is <code>orb</code> by Paul Mach (see <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/paulmach/orb">here</a>). It has all the geospatial primitives + other helpful functions such as clip, intersect, etc. In addition, it has great support for OSM operations such as an osm.pbf reader and converstions to GeoJSON - bear in mind that although is the same author this is not directly in the <code>orb</code> package but the <code>osm</code> one (see <a href="https://github.com/paulmach/osm">here</a>). My favourite part is the tile utilities and if you&rsquo;re creative enough, you could build an application all the way from reading osm.pbf files to mbtiles. To highlight how good this library is, <a href="https://protomaps.com/">Protomaps</a> use it for converting mbtiles to pmtiles in their CLI tool <a href="https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles">go-pmtiles</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rust">Rust</h1>
<p>I found Rust to be a buzz word in 2023. The two things I often hear is: hard &amp; amazing. I postponed learning Rust for a considerable amount of time as many blog posts had put me off due to the &lsquo;steep learning curve&rsquo;, &lsquo;constant compiler fights&rsquo; or having to do things &rsquo;the Rust way&rsquo;. But over the last few weeks I finally experimented with Rust and after few &lsquo;fights&rsquo; I developed and pusblished v0.1.1 of osm-waters (see previous post). Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the package is a work in progress and needs lots of work but the fact that I got a CLI tool out within few weeks of using Rust says something. I agree, the compiler is very <em>complainy</em> but on the other hand, my became very productive after few attempts. In terms of GIS, Rust has surprised me (and excited me) with its many &lsquo;geo&rsquo; packages available! There&rsquo;s a handy website called <a href="https://georust.org/">GeoRust</a> which amalgamates many powerful GIS packages. You can see it for yourself, you can find all kind of utilities with GeoRust. For instance, the <code>geo</code> (see <a href="https://crates.io/crates/geo">here</a>) package contains all the geospatial primitives such as Point, LineString or Polygon + other handy tricks. To underscore how powerful the GeoRust ecosystem is, the well-regarded <a href="https://martin.maplibre.org/">Martin</a> tile server by <a href="https://maplibre.org/">MapLibre</a> uses many of those libraries under the hood.</p>
<h1 id="my-hot-take">My hot take</h1>
<p>To start with, I must mention that both Go and Rust are fantastic languages to code in and can bring substantial performance compared to languages such as Python or JavaScript. There are many other areas I could mention such as memory safety, error handling, etc as there are many blog posts in the web - this is about using Go or Rust for geospatial applications. In terms of differences, I agree that Go can be slower than Rust - by a fair margin - but that&rsquo;s only an important matter if you&rsquo;re building applications that require sheer performance. For me, Go excels for its simplicity which in turn makes it easy to adopt - you can get developers coding in no time. On the other hand, Rust performance is incredible - but you pay the price in terms of steeper learning curve.</p>
<p>The deal breaker for me is the GIS ecosystem. It is a well-known fact that Go has much more mature libraries available. This is true and Rust libraries are more &lsquo;rough around the edges&rsquo;. But interestingly enough, I found the opposite when it comes to GIS. The fact of the matter is that Go has only one decent library and is not as active as I would personally like - some PRs have been sitting for some time with unanswered questions. On the other hand, the GeoRust ecosystem is simply incredible. It may sound bias but Rust&rsquo;s GIS ecosystem is far superior than Go. Night and day.</p>
<p>So here it comes, my hot take. <code>If you're looking to develop something quick &amp; simple then Go is a clear winner. But if you want to build a more custom GIS application with solid performance (and have extra development time) then - undoubtly - use Rust.</code></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
