			<p>First of all, by a &rsquo;tile generator&rsquo; I mean a tool that can move transform osm.pbf files to useful data - either in mbtiles, pmtiles or as database. Also, when I often hear about a tile generator, it is not only about converting osm.pbf files to mbtiles/database but also about sorting out its classification into something simpler. The prime example is OpenStreetMap. OSM is a very powerful service with so much geospatial data <ins>freely available</ins> but with the caveat that its schema is complex. The OSM&rsquo;s data classification a is very rich and granular as it has to cover so many different cases, but for the majority of us, the OSM schema is too much.</p>
<h1 id="openmaptiles">OpenMapTiles</h1>
<p>The old dog. Truly tested over the years, OpenMapTiles is a solid option to generate your own tiles. OMT isn&rsquo;t only popular for transforming data but als for its famous schema. The advantage of OMT is that it covers many use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want data to be in a database? Covered ‚úÖ</li>
<li>Want data to be in mbtiles? Covered ‚úÖ</li>
<li>Want to modify layers in depth? Covered ‚úÖ</li>
<li>Want to get the whole planer? Covered ‚úÖ</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on and on! Undoubtedly, OMT is very rich in features. But not all is perfect. OMT also has some annoyances that may be a deal breaker for you. To start with, OMT is a &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; tool as it contains many features but that comes at a cost if you only want couple of things from it. It also feels a bit &lsquo;blackboxy&rsquo; due to its structure. OMT isn&rsquo;t really a tool but an amalgamation of many tools written in SQL, Go, C++ or Python glued with a bit of Bash and wrapped in Docker. What a picture! This to me presents a non-trivial problem when debugging or deploying in Kubernetes, I have experienced this myself.</p>
<h1 id="tilemaker">TileMaker</h1>
<p>The (relatively) new kid in the block. The beauty of this tool is that there&rsquo;s no database involved which often implies some infrastructure costs. And it doesn&rsquo;t complicate its life either: you give an osm.pbf file and it outputs an mbtiles file. Simple. What is also nice about TileMaker is that it can assemble the data with the popular OpenMapTiles schema. It has multiple features for dropping unnecessary data and simplifying geometries and is relatively fast for medium sized areas. The biggest downside of TileMaker is its performance for large areas or the whole world. This is not a subjective matter, this is an ongoing issue in their GitHub page and to get tiles to planet level you will need a highly performant machine and 16 hours+.</p>
<h1 id="shortbread">Shortbread</h1>
<p>The last contender is Shortbread - a new initiative by the folks are Geofabrik. This seems promising in terms of its schema. Perhaps because the wealth of experience by Geofabrik that they are able to propose an alternative to the OMT schema - see here for more details. The only problem with Shortbread is that in reality it&rsquo;s all about the schema because to process data it uses TileMaker under the hood. This presents a problem once again as it raises some issues when wanting tiles at planet scale.</p>
<h1 id="missed-contenders">Missed contenders</h1>
<ul>
<li>PlanetTiler: this one looks really good but I have no experience using it. My bigger problem comes at the lack of ability to customise a schema - it is more prepared recipes in terms of data classification.</li>
<li>osm2pgsql, osmium &amp; tippecanoe: solid CLI tools loved by the GIS community. My only reason for not including such tools is because they lack the ability to create custom schemas.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the open-sourced GIS community is really missing a more simple and well-rounded CLI tool. I personally would love to see a Rust CLI that mixes the simplicity of TileMaker and the features of OpenMapTiles - particularly its highly customisable schema.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
