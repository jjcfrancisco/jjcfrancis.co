      <description>After few late nights and lots of coffee I release the first version of osm-wate.rs. A small tool written in Rust ü¶Ä to get OSM water bodies that intersect with your chosen geometries. The CLI is a work in progress but it is fast&amp;hellip; I mean, really fast! It processed over 1GB of polygons in only 4 seconds!&#xA;-&amp;gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the package&#xA;Enjoy!</description>

      <description>First of all, by a &amp;rsquo;tile generator&amp;rsquo; I mean a tool that can move transform osm.pbf files to useful data - either in mbtiles, pmtiles or as database. Also, when I often hear about a tile generator, it is not only about converting osm.pbf files to mbtiles/database but also about sorting out its classification into something simpler. The prime example is OpenStreetMap. OSM is a very powerful service with so much geospatial data freely available but with the caveat that its schema is complex.</description>
